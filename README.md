Major Project | Bachelor's Degree | Nov 2023 â€“ May 2024

EcoGirth is an innovative IoT-based system developed to automate tree health monitoring through real-time girth measurement using sensors and microcontrollers. The system combines hardware-level integration (using C, PCB, and embedded systems) with cloud-enabled Python scripts for continuous data transmission, processing, and visualization.

ðŸ”¹ Key Contributions:

Designed and implemented custom PCB integrated with sensors to measure tree girth accurately.

Programmed microcontroller units (MCUs) in C for sensor data acquisition and control logic.

Utilized Python and IoT platforms for real-time data streaming, visualization, and remote monitoring.

Enabled wireless data access for stakeholders involved in forest management, conservation, and urban planning.

ðŸ”¹ Impact:

Enhances environmental data accuracy and accessibility.

Promotes sustainable decision-making through automated ecological monitoring.

Reduces manual efforts and errors in long-term environmental assessments.

By bridging embedded technology with machine learning and IoT, EcoGirth represents a smart, scalable, and eco-friendly solution for modern environmental monitoring systems.
