# EcoGirth
EcoGirth is an innovative IoT-based system developed to automate tree health monitoring through real-time girth measurement using sensors and microcontrollers. The system combines hardware-level integration (using C, PCB, and embedded systems) with cloud-enabled Python scripts for continuous data transmission, processing, and visualization.
